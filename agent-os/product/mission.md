# Product Mission

## Pitch

Prism is a Discord AI bot that brings personality, memory, and fun to conversations with a close friend group by providing dynamic persona switching, contextual awareness, and playful emoji intelligence.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Personal Discord Server**: A private friend group server where members want an engaging, personalized AI companion

### User Personas

**Server Regular** (20s-30s)
- **Role:** Discord server member and friend
- **Context:** Casual conversations, gaming sessions, sharing content, and group banter
- **Pain Points:** Generic AI bots lack personality; conversations feel robotic and impersonal
- **Goals:** Have fun interactions with an AI that feels like part of the group, not a utility

**Server Admin (You)**
- **Role:** Bot maintainer and server owner
- **Context:** Managing the bot, customizing personas, and ensuring it fits the server culture
- **Pain Points:** Most bots are one-size-fits-all with no easy customization
- **Goals:** Full control over bot behavior, easy persona management, and reliable operation

## The Problem

### Boring, Impersonal AI Bots

Most Discord AI bots respond with generic, sterile messages that feel disconnected from server culture. They lack personality, context awareness, and the ability to adapt to different conversational moods.

**Our Solution:** Prism provides switchable personas with distinct personalities, maintains conversation memory per channel, and uses intelligent emoji integration to match the casual, fun tone of Discord conversations.

## Differentiators

### Personality-First Design

Unlike utility-focused bots that prioritize function over form, Prism treats personality as a core feature. Each persona has unique traits, communication styles, and behavioral patterns that make conversations feel natural and entertaining.

### Contextual Memory

Prism remembers recent conversations per channel, allowing it to maintain context and provide coherent, relevant responses rather than treating each message in isolation.

### Emoji Intelligence

Rather than ignoring or overusing emojis, Prism intelligently suggests and enforces emoji usage based on context, making responses feel native to Discord's expressive culture.
