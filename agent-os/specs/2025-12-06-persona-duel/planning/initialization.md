# Initial Feature Idea

**Feature Name:** Persona Duel

**Description:** Two personas argue about a user-suggested topic with slow message pacing to simulate real conversation, emoji reactions to each other's messages, configurable argument length/rounds, AI awareness of remaining time for strategic arguments, and a judge AI that declares a winner.

**Context:** This is for a Discord bot with multiple AI personas. The bot already has:
- Multiple AI personas with distinct personalities
- Persona switching via slash commands
- AI-assisted custom persona creation
- Persona editing and deletion
- Per-channel contextual memory with 30-day retention
- Smart emoji suggestions based on context
- Automatic emoji enforcement in responses
- Guild-scoped configuration
- OpenRouter AI integration with fallback model support
